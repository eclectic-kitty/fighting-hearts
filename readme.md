Title:
Fighting Hearts


Background:
You play as a person struggling with themselves, quite literally. Dozens of yourselves will fly at you, armed to the teeth with knives. It may not seem like much but you’ve got lots and lots of love to protect yourself with! 


Instructions:
The rules are simple, you need to avoid the knives and love yourself by firing hearts at yourself. Love as many of your selves as you can to rack up self-love points! Every five selves that you love will replenish one of your health bars. There’s also a friend that will appear if you lose enough health to boost your abilities. You must fire hearts at them in order to pick them up, and then equip the ability they grant you to use it. However, there is a limit to how much you can use your friend’s help; they might get burned out on helping you and leave.


Note: there is no main menu or anything like that. Just run the application to start the game, and close it and open it again after dying.


Controls:
Move with wasd or the arrow keys
Fire hearts with the space bar
Equip friend ability with e


Platforms:
Mac OS, Linux, or Windows.

Questions:
* Does the difficulty curve work for you? Is it too hard, too easy, or does it change over a round?
* Do you fire blindly or try to aim?
* Is the friend (powerup) helpful without making the game too easy?
* How do you feel about the speed of the evil you’s, the knives, and the hearts?
* How long did it remain engaging for? What made it most engaging?
* Did it feel rewarding to gain the friend’s ability after freeing them from the bubble?
* Was it hard to avoid the knives, and was it because of your avatar’s shape, or because of the knife behaviour?
